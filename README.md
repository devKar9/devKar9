- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @devKar9
- Iâ€™m interested in many things. My background is mechanical engineering but am branching out to learn skills towards an eventual career change.
  My hobbies include watching sports (especially college football, college basketball, and racing), playing videogames, camping with family, 
  and swimming (former D1 collegiate swimmer).
- Iâ€™m currently learning solidity programming. I've invested in my self by purchasing udemy and personal courses along with books
  to kick start my knowledge of the world of solidity programming.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on testnet solutions building new projects that further the innovation and maturity of the cryptocurrency space. 
  Other collaborative ideas include useful processing of data for the masses to be able to interpret what is happening on-chain.
